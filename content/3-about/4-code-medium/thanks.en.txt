All the development that Sylvain Jul√© made for the website and the player is open-source and  available (link: http://github.com/sylvainjule/ethicsfordesign-website text: here target: _blank).

All the full interviews and photos made for the documentary will soon be available (link: https://vimeo.com/232973887 text: here target: _blank).

If you want to translate the documentary's subtitles in your own language, the roadmap is to be found (link: http://github.com/sylvainjule/ethicsfordesign-subtitles text: here target: _blank). Once we've received your subtitles version we'll check for mistakes and then integrate it into the player.
